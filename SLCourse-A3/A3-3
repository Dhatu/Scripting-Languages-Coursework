(a) Find a pattern that removes any white spaces from the start and end of a line. Note: For
this part of the question modify the 1.f script so that it prints the modified input string to
STDOUT.

1)s/\s//g

2)"My name is Sudhin	Domala" => "MynameisSudhinDomala"
  "Devil	May	Cry" => "DevilMayCry"


(b) Find a pattern that matches any line of input that has the same word (note it is word, not
pattern) repeated two or more times in a row. Assume that consecutive words are separated
by one or two spaces

1)(\w+)\s{1,2}\1
2) "one two two one"
   "three  three three  four"


(c) Find a pattern that matches a line in which every word is surrounded by spaces. An
empty line always matches.

1)(\s+\w+\s+)*/g

2) " This is question three on the homework "
   " tic tac toe "


(d) Find a pattern that matches a line in which every word is adjacent to a space. An empty
line always matches.

1) (\s\w+ | \w+\s)/g

2) "string example"
   "stringexamplenumber stringexamplenumber 2"
