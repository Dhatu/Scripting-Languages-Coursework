This Coursework demostrates prowess in Perl, Python and Linux/Unix.

This course introduced the principles of scripting,
covers few selected scripting languages in depth, and illustrates the advanced use of scripting by
extensive case studies in application areas such as system administration, Web application
development, graphical user interface development, and text processing. 

Completion of this Course entails my ability to:

- Read and maintain existing scripting programs in the languages studied
- Effectively utilize and compose common command-line utilities
- Identify and determine if scripting is suitable given a software requirement specification
- Analyze the requirement specification, design, and implement moderately-sized scripting
programs
